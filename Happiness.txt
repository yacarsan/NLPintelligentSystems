Your burst of laughter
An exploding waterfall
Bring me happiness
Written Jan.4,2008
$
Happy is the one,
and happy is he alone
who can truly call
today his very own
he who can boldly
stand up and say
tomorrow come
and do what you may
I have lived the best today

Love is so beautiful,
In love there is loss,
Life is still beautiful,
Do not cause loss,
If it occurs to you,
Just accept it.
None causes loss,
It just happens,
Forgive those,
Who appear to have,
Caused loss to you,
Forgiveness is noble.
Let her be happy,
And at peace,
If she could not,
She would have a reason,
Let god take care of her,
Wish her happiness and peace.

There is a drunk boy in my bed and he smells.
I want him to leave so I can wash the sheets,
clean up,
arrange things, erase this episode
in my single hood.
Scandal, scandal, scandal, boys boys boys:
woke up this morning, no love in the bed.
You and I should meet for lunch. You can give me
advice. I sometimes feel judged. But that is from my
friends who aren't getting any.
Right now I guess I am wrapped up in the excitedness of it all.
But it is getting lonely here because most of my friends are getting
married.
One day, after all of this I will be married and happy and all that
Love, Anita.

Where is happiness?
Why it doesn't show up lately?
Why it doesn't sound lately?
Why it doesn't feel lately?
or we don't know it
don't feel it anymore
don't see it anymore
don't want it anymore
Who's deserve it?
Who's need it?
Who's deny it?
Who's is it?
it feels
when you feels
someone else
feels it
it sounds
when you hears
someone else
sings it
it shows
when you sees
someone else
paints it
it rounds
when you are there
with someone else
works on it
it depends
how much you care
how much you dare
how much you need
it fragrances
in the blossom
of your flowers, your forests
of your smiles, your gardens
it dances
in the charming
of your pets, your seas
of your laughs, your children
it walks
in the colorful
of your trees, your lakes
of your rivers, your mountains
it jumps
in the joyful
of your Birthday, your parents
of your beloved, your friends
everyone deserve it
everyone need it
no one deny it
nothing like it

Photographs capture memories
Good and bad alike
Sad times and happy times
They capture the emotion
Mom, leaning into Dad
Smiling, with presents in her hands
Her bright-red hair, blending with Dad's
As she sits in her Pooh Bear sweatshirt
Dad sits there, smiling,
In my favorite plaid, green shirt,
Reading the newspaper
It's Christmas Eve down in the basement
They sit on the blue-striped sofa,
Sitting close together
They smile as I take the photo
The last little bit of happiness
Mom and Dad were happy then,
But they're not anymore
They don't talk, smile, or even hug
They hardly show emotion
It takes its toll on my family
Last night Dad called me, crying
I love my mom and I love my dad,
But I don't think I can choose
I'll always have this photo, though,
To remind me of back then-
Back when they were happy
When I had that camera in my hand.
$
Their judgment untrue
I cannot see
why it means so much
to torcher me
Why they cannot simply
let me go
why their hated words
seem rehearsed to flow
Maybe they've always held this deep down
maybe I was always an enemy
behind their loving frown
It doesn’t mean as much
to tell them I’m not free
nor that I didn't commit a crime
that I am not guilty
Or at least that’s what I tell myself
and maybe I am wrong
maybe though I did no action
my heart sang a guilty song
So if it makes them happy
I shall tell them how
that I did desire
any better now?
But I held my tongue
and put hands to the sky
this I will tell you
is no lie
Can you blame me for wanting?
I'm a human too
and when you really think about it
that’s what humans do
So give me your sober looks
if it helps you ease
I will stay a nomad as I was
so hate me if you please
$
The happiness of others is my happiness-
Their sadness is my sadness-
Without them I cannot wholly be who I am-
And what they are to me
Helps make me real to myself.

Hypnotic beats
Melodic rhythms
Close your eyes
Listen and hear
Explore the gift of your senses
Open the door to the power they contain
I want to show you a place where time stands still?
Where there are no rules or room for judgment
In this space that thrives on unique self expression
Maybe you have been to this amazing wonderland?
Take my hand - hold it softly in yours
Devote your soul to the joy that is music
Let the warming melody swirl and dance
Allow your mind to absorb beautiful sounds
Now open your eyes – and open your ears
We are here –
We are not alone in this dream
Look around with a perception now so bright and clear
Friendly smiles kindly greet us with acceptance
Priceless emotions soak up every inch of space
Do you feel the bliss that I feel?
Are you able to hear the gift of sound in the music?
Can you see with a vision of peace and tranquility?
I look into your eyes glistening like shining glass
Your smile glowing with radiance from within
The hug we shared held the warmth of a close friend
Silently but quite clearly your answer is evident
Welcome to happiness.

Behind the door of happiness hides a frown,
who’s always afraid to come out.
She’s afraid to show herself to everyone,
so she always lets a smile out.
No matter how sad or deeply hurt,
she pretends as if there’s nothing wrong.
So she always put her smile on,
to prove that she is strong.
But when she couldn’t bare the pain no more,
the smile’s no where to be found.
The frown finally came out of the door,
but no comfort was around.
Rainy springs and long hard winters,
was like autumn’s cold windy breeze.
Throughout the year and into the summer,
she was never truly pleased.
Behind the door of happiness hides a frown,
who’s always afraid to come out.
She’s afraid to show herself to everyone,
so she always lets a smile out.
$
Greet the bright dawn with joy,
Raise your spirit to the light,
Then your smile you must employ,
Swiftly expelling the gloomy night.
A new day comes into view,
To be shaped and to redesign,
And each move will be, by you
So perfect, so right and fine.
The birds will start their song,
And delight in this newborn day,
And with your courage so strong,
Exhilaration will come your way.
Greet the bright  dawn with joy,
Don't give in to tears and stress,
Find nothing that might annoy,
Come to know complete happiness.

Buying a car today would be so nice!
Having a car thats old is quite alright;
Getting a car tomorrow would be wise!
Changing a car each day would not be right.
Having something thats old is good enough;
Having something today seems still better;
Having something tomorrow is quite tough;
Yet, satisfaction's prime that must matter.
Each thing in time has its advantages;
Postponement's not something you always do;
One shouldn't decide slowly or take ages;
All things have demerits and beauty too!
Yet, values old have stood the test of time!
And modern things don't make life more sublime!
$
I’ve never thought
In terms of happiness,
It always seemed
More mythic than Zeus
And less obtainable
Than gold and other precious stones.
I do what I have to do to survive,
I try to show kindness to strangers,
Apologize when I hurt someone,
Never relish in an enemy’s demise,
And never take anything
That isn’t rightfully mine.
What I’ve missed in happiness
Will be returned in the perfumed breeze
Of spring flowers
That God will waft to me
When I lie down in eternal sleep.
$
TOGETHER at the altar we
In vision oft were seen by thee,
Thyself as bride, as bridegroom I.
Oft from thy mouth full many a kiss
In an unguarded hour of bliss
I then would steal, while none were by.
The purest rapture we then knew,
The joy those happy hours gave too,
When tasted, fled, as time fleets on.
What now avails my joy to me?
Like dreams the warmest kisses flee,
Like kisses, soon all joys are gone.
$
Sometimes it flutters
Gaily round my sparkling smiles
Like a butterfly;
Sometimes it glides in the air
Like soap bubble- Touch- It pricks!
$
Confused tired and weary,
Like white clouds above,
Drifting in an untold story;
Night’s desire wrapped in cove,
With arms not lonely though;
Waiting for happy tomorrow,
To bring a passion to fend,
And not to drift in old sorrow,
Hoping to bring an end,
With the happiness borrowed;

“Happiness resides not in possessions, and not in gold, ”
“The feeling of happiness dwells in the soul.” Aristotle  Wise
words from a wise philosopher
What stirs up the soul, to warm the heart, and sets the spirit free?
Is it baby’s first word, - a promotion at work, or just to be - little ole
Me?
Some of us are in search of a world of perceptual bliss
However, here on Earth this world just simply does not exist
Along with the good times, we must learn to live with the bad
Living to make a wrong, right, a feeling of happiness we
Magically add
To turn a hopeless frown, into a new awaking smile,
Is when you discover a solution, which needs to be nourished
With a walk - of an additional mile
Do not look at your brother and see, - All of the external bad
Look inside to see - all of the good, - this is what will make you
Glad

Troublesome swirls”

For we have to dive - for pearls

I am here with the music,
Never more to roam.
I am up beyond white clouds
Because Heaven is my home.
All my life I have waited
To be where you are,
I am here with the music
And my faithful guitar.
The gates they were golden
The roses were red
When I entered herein
Like a sheep I was led.
But I'll live here forever
With the ones I adore,
I am here with the music
Through Heaven's open door.

‘Does Happiness depend upon comfort? ’
The answer is definitely a big, ‘No! ’
Happiness lies in not comforts alone!
Happiness is not a static quality of the human mind, body and soul.
All can’t remain happy all the time.
It would be foolishness to wish for a life, filled with happiness alone;
Happiness is more when woes come in-between.
Happiness is just a feeling weird!
Life could become boring and monotonous, when happiness is prolonged.
Even the pauper can be happier than the prince.
Even the beggar smiles and sleeps well, despite much strife.
Happiness is a frame of mind that’s dynamic in nature;
Happiness is a kind of mood of feeling very well;
Happiness is a state of one, when life seems worth living;
Happiness is something strange that varies with time, experience and wisdom.
Happiness is all within;
Happiness is in giving;
Happiness is in sharing;
Happiness is the ceiling, whatever you fix!
Happiness does not wholly depend on comforts;
Happiness cannot be bought by money;
Happiness is not all luxury;
Happiness is abstract to the core!
Happiness is in being child-like, though adult;
Happiness is in making and seeing the less fortunate ones, smile;
Happiness is in acting adult-like, although a child
Happiness is in giving something to someone, although you still need it.
Happiness is in sacrificing for others’ sake;
Happiness is in giving up your chance to someone, who most needs it;
Happiness is in doing acts of charity;
Happiness is when you’ve led a righteous life.
Happiness to some is in dreams alone;
Happiness to some doing risky feats;
Happiness to a few is in a sheer lazy life;
Happiness to some is in yeoman service to mankind.
Happiness is a phenomenon;
Happiness is a quirk of fate;
Happiness is quite rare and scarce at times;
Happiness to some is in living in a virtual world!
Happiness is in braving the storms of life;
Happiness is in toiling for others’ sakes;
Happiness is in sharing your talents and ken;
Happiness is in loving your poor brethren.

Happiness is the way to happiness!

There's a certain kind of magic,
that exists within your eyes.
It's there I can see what I mean to you…
It's there you loose your disguise.
There's something in your movements,
so assured, so strong and true.
It's no wonder there are entire days,
when I can think of only you.
There is a certain moment,
it happens right before we kiss…
it's a moment filled with splendor…
followed by a moment filled with bliss.
There is a magical tingle,
when ever you touch my skin.
The same way you touch my spirit,
which warms me from within.
There's something in your face,
I see it often in your stare.
It's your patient understanding,
that makes me always want you near.
There's a calmness in your hug,
and a peace that echo's your voice.
There's singing in your laughter,
that makes my heart rejoice.
There are moments when I wonder,
why destiny chose you for me.
At times I feel it's so I can learn,
to be the person I'm supposed to be.
I can't explain the things I see…
what I know and sense and feel.
But I can explain what's in my heart…
it's a love that's pure and real.
Treasure's are meant to be found,
by the lucky ones picked by fate.
I must be one of the luckiest around,
to have deserved you for my mate.
Together as a team we're invincible.
I just wish I could make you see.
That love is the answer for true happiness…
True happiness is…you loving me.
To E.M. My one and only...I Love You

Snow began to fall at ten in the evening
fine cold adamantine snow.
On Atlantic I drove slowly, the streets being slippery,
looking for a lady
when I spotted Johnnie Mai
so pulled up next to her and she hopped into the car
and we drove to my apartment
where she quickly stripped
then made hot chocolate.
“This is a nice place, Bernstein,
sometimes I stay with Dempsey
he’s forty and loves me
but not my baby.”
“Mary with your mother? ” I asked.
Johnnie Mai sipped her hot chocolate slowly
in silence
eyes closed drifting into that private world
where a soul’s history tumbled forever alone
when suddenly she said, “Without
my mama I’d be dead,
also Mary.” Eyes open staring at me
then: “I guess we should do it.”
“That would be nice.”
We walked to the bed
the presence of her youthful
and powerful body affected me deeply:
My turn now to drift
as her gracious passion warped warmth
into me, so tender, almost true.
“Now me cause I’m still a woman
even though I take money.”
Later she asked, “Can I stay? ”
“OK, ” I said.
Then in the tinkling of an eye
she was asleep and I slid out of bed
walked to the window raised the blinds
to see in the distance Downstate Medical Center
shimmering in the descending crystals
where at this very moment most certainly
death shaped a soul into a snowflake.
I returned to Johnnie Mai her body still afire
and pressed close
a profound silence in the dark room
and I did nothing to disturb it.

Happiness to gain

The great stone Hall is silent
that is now millennia old.
Through the western windows
shines a glorious sun.
It floods the walls and floors,
the tables, chairs and doors,
panelling, pictures, artefacts
and illumines every one
until the wraiths that gather
cry out in their joy,
'Everything is gold!
Whatever is, is gold! '
A majestic cloud
emerges from the southern sea,
slides across the western sky
blotting out the sun.
Light through those western windows
pales to a thin grey day.
It dims the walls and floors,
the tables, chairs and doors,
panelling, pictures, artefacts
pales every one
until the wraiths in the shadows
cry out in dismay,
'Gone is gold, the gold is gone!
All joy has passed away! '

Happiness is when you have very few troubles and worries,
It's when you have no reason to say to someone you're 'Sorry'.
Happiness is when you have someone to love,
It's when you can have a full-fledged conversation with the God above.
Happiness is when it's a rainy day, in your eyes the flowers blossom and the sun gleams,
It's when you're almost convinced you're in a dream.
Happiness is a feeling that comes from within,
Its a fast flowing, merry and jumpy sort of rhythm.
When there's no happiness, take a second and shut your eyes,
Just imagine if there was some, what it would be like.
Imagine you're in a bright colourful garden, imagine you're in heaven,
Within  a few seconds you'll be on top of cloud seven.

I asked the professors who teach the meaning of life to tell
me what is happiness.
And I went to famous executives who boss the work of
thousands of men.
They all shook their heads and gave me a smile as though
I was trying to fool with them
And then one Sunday afternoon I wandered out along
the Desplaines river
And I saw a crowd of Hungarians under the trees with
their women and children and a keg of beer and an
accordion.
$
Happiness is elusive like the wind
Coming and going like migrating birds
And sound of echoing peals of church bells.
I would keep love safe and strong
Held fast within my heart
Never lost to furies of a purple storm.
Once, I was happy and royal with my lover
Not knowing it was supreme
And through folly have lost all to loneliness.
$
happiness  has  no  shore
cannot  touch, can never  reach
could only feel  and  long  for
has  no  colour  or smell
mood  does or  undoes  it

Happiness in usually free,
for both you and me.
But what I see is something else,
big box big fee.
Happiness should be free,
but for many it is not.
Happiness cost some their life and home,
and the dog his bone.
Happiness can be free,
with just a little little effort.
Smile, give or embrace,
or just show your support.
Happiness is without cost,
I am sure we are not lost.
We are all in the same boat,
just wish we could stay afloat.
$
Happiness perhaps once had features
Of a single, compact whole,
But countless are the craving creatures
Praying God some bliss to dole.
He therefore must have sadly shattered
Happiness into many a bit
And had the pieces widely scattered
To give all eyes a glimpse of it.
So, those who wish to own a share
Should not think it strain or stress
To search around, with utmost care,
Some dazzling fragments to possess.
A particle here, a particle there,
To your happy lot may fall;
Not any time, not anywhere,
can you ever find them all.
However long, however far-
Spreading your quest may be,
Too many are, too tiny are
The splinters all for you to see.
In common can you best enjoy
Whatever happiness comes your way.
With others if you share your joy,
It well may stage a longer stay.
Give your neighbour just a half
And see your pleasure growig double:
Make your neighbour smile or laugh;
You yourself with glee will bubble.

I have finally escaped,
to a majestic place,
where i feel at home,
no cobwebs on the phone,
my happiness is burning like a never ending flame,
my soul is free and i feel so alive,
and there is no-one here to tell me,
no-one to dictate,
no-one to irritate,
to  play me around,
I'm so free,
and I'm finally...
happy

Like a baby borne, sun rises up everyday
With the same spirit, strength
Same light being surrounded
By dew it only gives happiness
People today have forgotten
To realize, true essence
Of this talking nature,
Only speaks the truth!
Says it louder
But we, going away
Ignore it, putting it to an end
To the signal that’s yelling
Happiness is within
Find it inside, not anywhere
In nature’s lap
Nowhere else
Chirping birds, crocking frogs
Newly born day
And its aroma
All is for free
Just need is it to get it
Get it on time
It is omnipresent
Happiness is all over
$
You cannot buy your happiness,
'Cause happiness is free.
Don't you know, or can't you guess,
It's there for you and me.
And what you do with what you've got,
Can change the way you feel.
Just do your best and smile a lot,
You'll keep an even keel.
'Cause happiness is made for YOU,
Just take a bite and see
That happiness is what you do
With something that is free.

What is happiness without any pain?
What is happiness without any gain?
Happiness is contentment.
Happiness may also be a wonderful achievement.
Happiness can be defined as satisfaction
Which we get after doing a noble action.
Happiness can be achieved by doing selfless deeds.
By this we can sow the 'Humanity seeds'
Love one another as I have loved you,
Follow this golden principle and you will find,
Happiness awaiting you with arms
open and welcoming you.
$
To hear your smiles
To feel your joy
Your warm hearted laughter
spilling across my shoulder
Tender hands creating soft sighs
Then turning to see the light of the sky
as it bends to touch your eyes
Knowing you is a special happiness
A small child's hugging arm at my hip
The glistening shine on its plump lower lip,
quickly moistened after a delectable treat
Then the blush of color on the full
rounded cheek
This is a moment of happiness
A quiet night of deep restful sleep.
The wake to the languid, tingling, feeling, of reach
for arms that continue to keep on running to encircle one another
Yet open wide to welcome each others feats
This is the ultimate happiness
$
Stuff may happen that will get you down
Don't worry about it happiness will come around
Through the dark light will come
Someones always waiting for your love
In the thick and in thin
Someone's always waiting within
Your heart may shrink your heart will grow
All that i want you to know
Is that I LOVE YOU
$
Candles of faith dazzling
through the nights
Fumes of aroma awake
all existing senses
Seasonal melodies
germinate divine feelings
Heavenly stars remind us
of wishful thinking
Flowery thoughts disperse
essences of hope
Cherishing life throughout
joyous times
Showers of miracles extinguish
burning fires
Patience brings
a rosy hue to life
Cascades of tears have
eventually ceased
Flames of pain have entirely
disappeared
Darkness of sorrow has
completely vanished
Candles of happiness
are eternally lit

I've never trusted happiness.
We've never quite been friends.
And everytime that my heart breaks,
It never really mends.
I wrote these words so long ago
And yet they still hold true.
This heart can hold no happiness.
The love just falls right through.
$
There's just no accounting for happiness,
or the way it turns up like a prodigal
who comes back to the dust at your feet
having squandered a fortune far away.
And how can you not forgive?
You make a feast in honor of what
was lost, and take from its place the finest
garment, which you saved for an occasion
you could not imagine, and you weep night and day
to know that you were not abandoned,
that happiness saved its most extreme form
for you alone.
No, happiness is the uncle you never
knew about, who flies a single-engine plane
onto the grassy landing strip, hitchhikes
into town, and inquires at every door
until he finds you asleep midafternoon
as you so often are during the unmerciful
hours of your despair.
It comes to the monk in his cell.
It comes to the woman sweeping the street
with a birch broom, to the child
whose mother has passed out from drink.
It comes to the lover, to the dog chewing
a sock, to the pusher, to the basket maker,
and to the clerk stacking cans of carrots
in the night.
It even comes to the boulder
in the perpetual shade of pine barrens,
to rain falling on the open sea,
to the wineglass, weary of holding wine.

Happiness,
when people ask me where I find happiness,
I don't have an answer,
when they inquire what my happiest memories are,
I just shake my head,
I can't say I have a happiest memory,
It's not because all my memories are painful,
or unmemorable,
no,
It's because I search for happiness in tommorow,
In the wonder of a new dawn,
In the excitement of the growing light,
There's always something better,
so why wallow in what has been,
when you can bask in what is to come,
I have no idea what tommorow will bring,
But one things for sure,
I can always hope for a brighter future,
and never ending happiness.
$
Happiness eludes me.
I chase after it in firsts, highs, greats, excellents.
Puff…it vanishes. It is fractions
Of seconds, tiny, invisible, gone.
I find it in compliments, smiles, laughs;
There it goes again.
I find it in love, the fractions
Are endless, it seems, repeated
So often that I think I have found it. For good.
No. It escapes again.
Every day I am gathering fractions,
Words, smiles, laughs, compliments,
Firsts, highs, greats, excellents,
Fractions, all fractions, they become smaller
And smaller, and I am left stranded.
Brave new world, show me your face,
Show me a new me.
Without the greats, the highs, the firsts,
Show me happiness.

Happiness in the dictionary pages
ricochets between
hap and hapless,
good luck and bad
Fortuna, Joy, Felicity
Aptness and Prosperity-
all aligned.
Happiness it seems
Has nothing to do with fair and unfair.
right and wrong
it is hit or miss
luck and unlucky-
vagaries.
Indigestible this.
My grandmother smiles:
“now there child” she used to say
“ok to be born rich
better to be born lucky.”
But, in America we are only guaranteed
happiness's Pursuit and it's Uncertainty.
Accidents of life
rule my chances at felicity?
What now to guide my dreams?
Fortuna's fates gamble
with my dusty dry uncertainties;
hoisted up or down the landscape-
wrangled Hope on a card game table?
Life's branding is: 'no guarantees.'
How many lives
random touched
careen direction-less?
Sad.
Wish I hadn't read the dictionary
but, again,
no such luck.
Hard Truth.
$
A man and a woman lie on a white bed.
It is morning. I think
Soon they will waken.
On the bedside table is a vase
of lilies; sunlight
pools in their throats.
I watch him turn to her
as though to speak her name
but silently, deep in her mouth--
At the window ledge,
once, twice,
a bird calls.
And then she stirs; her body
fills with his breath.
I open my eyes; you are watching me.
Almost over this room
the sun is gliding.
Look at your face, you say,
holding your own close to me
to make a mirror.
How calm you are. And the burning wheel
passes gently over us.
$
happiness is what i seek
happiness makes me weak.
plant the seed so it can grow
and in time it will show
the fruits of your labor
it is something that you can savor.
happiness can be found-if you turn and look around
happiness can be seen in your face.!
and it could spread throughout the land.
all it needs is'a helpng hand'.
$
Happiness is that which everyone longs
but so few of us actually get
Happiness is that which rights all wrongs
and leaves us without regret
Why then does happiness torture us so
when all we want is to feel
what happiness does in the lowest of low
when everything just seems too real
Happiness comes to so many of you
you who think it will always be there
Happiness leaves you without the clue
that living without is a nightmare
If happiness could be passed on
would you then give it to me
Will you then cry when it is gone
and realise what it is to feel lonely
(May,2007)
$
I am no Christ, Buddha or Gandhi
Or a wandering fakir or sanyasi.
I am an ordinary human being,
If someone slaps me
I cannot turn the other cheek.
I don't think it makes me weak.
I find it difficult to walk
On the eight fold path.
I have no lofty mission
To free mankind of suffering.
If I can make one person smile,
It makes me feel satisfied.
For I can not spread happiness and cheer,
If I am miserable and full of fear.
I cannot be totally selfless,
And efface my identity.
I owe it to myself to love me,
I don’t care if others feel
I am selfish.
Happiness is not something
You can achieve
Merely for the asking.
With experience you will find
It is a state of mind,
You attain when you make peace
With what is.
Once the awareness comes,
You are no longer feverish and
Others naturally feel comfort
In your company.
$
happiness is always an inside job
$
It's not so much the world outside
that make us sigh or smile.
It's more the thoughts within our head
that make life seem worthwhile.
Thoughts of special people
that we have met along the way
and memories of the happy times we've shared
from day to day.
I often wonder on a day like this
If you've ever guessed.
How many times the thought of you
has brought me happiness.
$
Money is not the happiness.
Happiness can't sell or buy.
My happiness is my friends,
My lover and my family.
My happiness is charities,
It is supported the people
Who cared about me?
It is also to help my mom
Recover her illness.
My happiness is my friends
At Poet's workshop
That fills up full time to
read and review poems.
My happiness is to plant
the flowers
and to spent time
for my love's ones.
It is also my love
for my great country
That gives me a freedom.
To think of the happiness,
An ordinary life and an inspiration.
$
Happiness is th smile that appears when your love walks through the door
It's the fact that everyday you love her even more
Happiness is smiling when nothing goes your way
Happiness is family when you've had a tired day
Where do you find happiness do you look up or down?
You find it in the mirror at the absence of a frown
Happiness can be described in so many different ways
So let's just hope when it finally comes it will never go away
$
Being your self
Even when it's not neccesairy, when it's not
required.
Even when the world's not
perfect and the sky has
it's clouds.
Just walking there
Just being
yourself
Just closing your eyes, smiling.
Just walking there,
existing,
breathing
Happiness.
$
It's a beautiful day not a cloud in sight,
and all I see is the sun shinning bright,
and feeling it’s warmth.
I am so happy to see the flowers
and trees are starting to bloom,
and gloom of the cold winter is almost over.
My happiness is to think of how much I love you.
More of my happiness is what you've brought to my life
and being your wife.
I want to Thank-you!
For meaning of my happiness
$
Happiness, oh happiness,
waiting to burst forth from me,
happiness.
To live in such splendour and
bathe in the milky sunlight,
I wish such a happiness,
existed for me.
To live in a world of anger,
trapped inside a bird's cage.
Why won't this happiness be mine?
Hatred fills my heart,
for this world full of anger,
Why can't this happiness be mine?
$
happiness
a feeling I never thought I’d find
a feeling I didn't believe in
a feeling I now have
a feeling I never want to lose
happiness
a feeling that is so strong
a feeling that can cure all
a feeling that is me
a feeling that made the new me
happiness
$
Sadness have strikes me
I fought harder and harder
To get the happiness back
I weeps frequently
I smiles frequently
Happiness is what I want in return
Having him support me
Gave me a happiness
Sadness have strikes me
I fought harder and harder
To get happiness back
I wore masks thousand times
I pretend and it hurt
Having him to take off my mask
To reveal the truth out of me
Gave me a happiness
Sadness have strikes me
I fought harder and harder
To get the happiness back
My heart is shattered
I grabbed a broom to gather it together
I cries
Having him glue my heart all together
Brought me into happiness once again.
$
Happiness is silent, or speaks equivocally for friends,
Grief is explicit and her song never ends,
Happiness is like England, and will not state a case,
Grief, like Guilt, rushes in and talks apace.
$
I never had this kind of amount before
Twenty hundred dollars of salary
My first job at the department store
After completed my studies at Baltimore
I am so happy to spend my money
With my family and more
With all my pals and a girl named Mandy
Celebration of joy before I walk out of the door
To further my studies in the Varsity
Everybody were so happy for me
Seeing me happy
One afternoon, I received a call from Mommy
Telling me I’ve been offered Psychology
At Michigan State University
I was so happy
My dreams would become a reality
Rockefeller is working in New York City
Upper Manhattan is the place of duty
Residing in Hoboken Avenue in New Jersey
Made him crossing the Hudson Bay daily
One day, while refueling his gas at Holland Tunnel
He met a woman named McConnell
Music from the station was playing a love song from the Beetles
She was smiling at him and hope that smiles could be eternal
Guess what?
That meeting was actually ending in a marriage
They’ve succeeded in crossing the bridge
The bridge of love and serenity
They were living happily
Form New Jersey to New York City
Is the distance to be
George Bush was feeling so happy
To be back in the White House eventually
The crucial votes in Florida
Had distant him from Al Gore and his brouhaha
It was a history
Was he really happy
Deep inside only he knows the story
As well as the first lady
$
What's happiness really?
A smile or a laugh,
A simple gesture of emotion.
A simple art of love and devotion.
An act of content and appreciation,
Or just a facial feature of contrast to one's hidden veil.
$
Ever again to breathe pure happiness,
So happy that we gave away our toy?
We smiled at nothings, needing no caress?
Have we not laughed too often since with Joy?
Have we not stolen too strange and sorrowful wrongs
For her hands' pardoning? The sun may cleanse,
And time, and starlight. Life will sing great songs,
And gods will show us pleasures more than men's.
Yet heaven looks smaller than the old doll's-home,
No nestling place is left in bluebell bloom,
And the wide arms of trees have lost their scope.
The former happiness is unreturning:
Boys' griefs are not so grievous as our yearning,
Boys have no sadness sadder than our hope.
$
Happiness
Is a clean bill of health from the doctor,
And the kids shouldn't move back home for
more than a year,
And not being audited, overdrawn, in Wilkes-Barre,
in a lawsuit or in traction.
Happiness
Is falling asleep without Valium,
And having two breasts to put in my brassiere,
And not (yet) needing to get my blood pressure lowered,
my eyelids raised or a second opinion.
And on Saturday nights
When my husband and I have rented
Something with Fred Astaire for the VCR,
And we're sitting around in our robes discussing,
The state of the world, back exercises, our Keoghs,
And whether to fix the transmission or buy a new car,
And we're eating a pint of rum-raisin ice cream
on the grounds that
Tomorrow we're starting a diet of fish, fruit and grain,
And my dad's in Miami dating a very nice widow,
And no one we love is in serious trouble or pain,
And our bringing-up-baby days are far behind us,
But our senior-citizen days have not begun,
It's not what I called happiness
When I was twenty-one,
But it's turning out to be
What happiness is.
$
a wonderful emotion
a thing everyone needs to find
a thing I never felt until now
something I will fight not to lose
something worth it all
worth the
pain
stress
depression
the struggle
it is worth the fight
and I will keep fighting to keep it
$
Should I wait for you to fall in love with me
Or should I just forget about it and let it be
I don't want to wait for heartbreak
Because you and I both know this is something I can't take
I know that you are in love with someone else
And I don't want to be in a relationship all by myself
I want to understand your decision about us
So don't be in a relationship that you can't trust
You will always have a place in my heart
A special designed place from the start
Maybe one day we can connect
That's if our love don't reject
I feel beautiful and I hope you do too
So in the future one of us will have to say I love you
Now is not the time
So be like me and change your mind
I hope that you find happiness too
But it's a choice up to you
It was either heartbreak or happiness
And happiness was something that I didn't want to miss

IN MY OLD AGE A GREAT HAPPINESS
In my Old Age
A great Happiness
Comes over me.
Why?
I cannot exactly say
I walk I sing
Music and Poetry in me.
The Spring
The Light the Flowers
Some Great Peace
Of all the years I have been
My children
My step-grandchildren
So much I love
Eretz Yisrael.
How happy the light
Of this green day
All the while
Forgetting
The fears of what might be
The uncertainy of what is
The pains of what will be-
A great Happiness
A great Happiness
Thank G-d I have here now still
Thank God for so much goodness in my life.

Let's go find that great blue yonder,
Far away from noise and rush,
A place where one can sit and ponder,
Silently, in a cocoon of hush.
With solitude, to rest one's senses,
Some time to grasp what life's about,
To knock down all those rigid fences,
And let your wildest thoughts fly out.
Allow for all your hopes to wander,
Into dreams that calm the mind,
And use the time in that great blue yonder,
Your innermost happiness to find.

If a wise man can be happy,
then happiness must be possible.
If a simple man can be happy,

I don’t give two shits anymore
all I want to do is die
that is all I wish for at night
is to die
no one would really care
I have no lover
not a friend to call
no one to address my suicide letter
I’m just sick of always felling nervous
feeling depressed
crying
I wonder would I ever be happy?
would I ever have a friend?
should I hope it will get better
the truth is
it won't
it never does
and you know what
I don't really care
because no happiness is worth this much pain
all the pain of getting there
then again how would I know I’ve never felt happiness

Provoked Thoughts
i find myself sitting
affront this velvet curtain
living an on-going lie
finding no thoughts of good
my shattered heart lost and empty
clinging to impossible dreams
a dreadful thought
my mind's eye sewn shut
with the thread of sorrow
spun from lost hope
not wanting to be found
$
life unfolding
behind the velvet curtain
lies forgiven
goodness redeemed
hearts unbroken
finding long-lost dreams
in a wishful thought
minds eyes open
to lost hope
now found

My life's greatest happiness is to be convinced my love to you
I am grateful to you for making me happy through out my life
I have never known love until I met you and your love touched
my heart and brought so much happiness in me
Today, you made me to see everything in a new life and you
want me to know how those happiness could make me happy
I found my happiness is to love you and to be loved from you
Sometime, I miss you so much and your absence is very painful
But when I carry your heart within me then my happiness is shining
When I am sad then your sweet words brings me happiness
and my soul get enough strength when it join your heart
When my heart wants to know the meaning of ' love'
then your love is making me to believe the truth of love
Without you there is no happiness in my life and with you
my life is full of hopes and my dream will come true
When you hold me in your arms then my heart
never want to let me go because your happiness is
my happiness. I love you so much my love.

Happiness
Can only be found
If you search for it
Like a vicious blood hound
Happiness
Is just like love
Just to get it
You will push and shove
Happiness
Is just a door
You open it up
And you just want more
Happiness
Grows like trees
It gets really big
But dies in a breeze
Happiness
Is what I could never find
So I went to the dark
To sit and hide
$
A very frothy, cup of coffee,
My sweetheart's kiss, which is sheer bliss,
Some time for me, plus a pot of tea,
Reflexology for the feet, now that's a treat,
His hand in mine, which is divine,
Being together, whatever the weather,
A trip to town, to buy a new gown,
That welcomed smile, when I've walked a mile,
One friendship rare, that we both can share,
My wedding ring, this makes my heart sing,
A chocolate bar, when I feel under par,
A new found pet, that I have just met,
The grandchild's grin, when I come in,
My daughter's pride, when I'm by her side,
My husband's face, which I could never replace.

I walk in the rain,
As I think about you,
Tears fall down,
As I remember what you said,
Love is a way of life,
Love is a way of heart,
Love is a part of you and me,
It’s a part of everyone,
I walk around,
Thinking of you,
As my heart is breaking,
And bleeding from the lies you told,
The blood is dripping,
Down my clothes,
It turned my shirt from red to black,
I remember what you said,
As your screaming and yelling at me,
I never really loved you,
I really only used you,
I never wanted you,
I really only HATE you!
I slice my wrist I wanted it to end,
The blood drips on the ground,
Rain starts to fall,
The ground around me turns red.

where i lost my happiness?
in the lighted corner of past,
this dark of present,
reminds me,
where i lost my happiness?
where i lost my family?
today on with thousands of tears
reminds me of those funny loving moments of past,
smiles, joy, happiness encircled with
my heart sang the song of delight.
my present a dark corner of life,
light me a candle light a flame of happiness,
where i lost my happiness?
where i lost my family?
the family past was not so suffery,
the family today cries for everything,
has everything around still sits to cry,
nothing known of children just busy on own.
i lost my family, i gained a dark corner,
i lost my happiness, or did i ever have them with me? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

an ode to happiness
happiness is one of the many emotions
maybe the greatest off all
it can make you feel all jumpy inside
a first kiss, first love
its all to do with happiness.
but yet happiness never gets thanked
for every thing it has done for us
so im saying thank you for bringing me steven, amy, fayeness, india and everyone else
that means something to me
thank you happiness

Honey, wanna fly
Take a walk upon the steel rails – slide
Skidding, three-sixties the world turns below
Into fear.  Wanna take a dive
Into Heaven or Hell?  She sees her mother’s
Pictures of that sweet baby girl that
She recognizes much to well.  Decides.
It’s alright.  Someone cares.
She turns to leave,
But trips.
Honey, wanna drive
Into a brick back alley wall
Just after she scores and
Takes control.  Woman your
Nose bleeds every time you
Contemplate love.  She worries
About kissing the arms of
The world good-bye.  Got to make
Things better.
Honey, wanna run in the night
Broken bikes and running thoughts
Woman goes insane upon misspelling
Her new last name.  Woman needs
To listen to the good ole rock-n-roll.
Sometimes I ain’t strong enough she
Sometimes knows, but never
Let’s me know what dark
Things lay covered in her
Mind’s shadows.
Honey, wanna cry
Feel a fool at a busted garden gate.
It’s no secreat that dandelions die
And friends always need your help.
Why?  Why do we shine like comets
Across the night sky – only to die.  Wanna
Drink a gallon of pesticide and write
Poetry about the experience
“It’ll be alright, ” momma always said, “It’ll be alright.”
Honey wanna skip rocks
Across the sea when the waves ain’t
High.  Woman falls ripping
Her dress as the universe explodes.
She knows there’s allot of things
That need changed about her life.
Wanna change her hair – paint it black
Cut it short like a boy’s,
But no one would notice.  She thinks twice.
Honey, wanna spit
In every man’s eye.
Later decides
It’s better to lie
And just fake
Orgasms and Happiness.

Eliminating passion is not happiness.
Suppressing passion is not happiness.
Spending passion only is happiness.
Happiness is nothing but the sprouts of happiness.

One grand boulevard with trees

No-one knew what subsequently became of her
after he went so dramatically, and after all those goings-on.
He got all the headlines.
The police didn't even bother
to take her in for questioning.
There was talk of riots,
they needed every spare man.
But the story never quite went away.
You know how it is with journalists -
we file it away for a rainy day,
then it sticks in our mind
for when we retire and write a best-seller, I wish...
I doubt we'll ever know the truth of it;
but every now and then
some nutter with a convincing sighting
makes a free gift to journalists
with no personal responsibility for us either.
France, Spain, Italy, gipsy communities -
you name it, they know her
except she was never there that day.
The story among her friends is
that she went on a long Mediterranean cruise
with two other ladies.
Yet there's no account of their returning
and there are stories that they all separated
and took up new careers in foreign places
where they acquired new names, locally
so the trail's gone cold.
But stories like his, and hers,
and whether they - well, you know -
never quite go away
and the part she played
though brief, sure was dramatic, so
it's made her a role model for those women -
and there have been many over the years -
whose lives have taken a turn for the worse
(no man can know what it's like
for a woman to hav e to sell herself)
and who see in her story
a hope of life's big U-turn
and all that we really hope for.
God knows we all need one.
Could be a Lloyd-Webber musical,
come to think of it.
After all, she was there
at one of the world's big events
- that most of the media
strangely missed...
Maddalena - it's a beautiful name
in Italian.
And then there's that delicate cake
that Proust dipped in his tea.
There's a place in Italy
where they take her story very seriously,
because some local writer
turned it into a classic of hope for the socially rejected;
a rather 19th century theme.
The critics panned it;  but does it matter
whether it's truth or fiction,
if it goes so deep, that it's true in a different sort of way?
It's called 'Maddalena of the Heavenly Happiness';
it sounds better in  Italian.
no, it never got translated into English -
it's rather
Catholic
if you know what I mean.
Though it actually took place
in the Near East
or whatever it was called then.

In Lusher park I met a young woman in her early twenties maybe
The sun was in her golden hair she said good day to me
A happy smile lit up her face and warmth in her friendly hi
And all around the sunlit park she spread her gift of joy.
A woman happy in herself and of care she did seem free
The brighter and happier side of life her type can only see
A woman with a cheery smile and warmth in her hello
She will spread her gift of happiness where ever she will go.
The lories and rosellas chirped on the trees and white backed magpie sung
And there was warmth in the breeze and the day was fresh and young
As she walked on down the pathway the one with the inner glow
And the brightness that is in her soul in her body language show.
I was feeling in a neutral mood not happy or not sad
Not feeling sorry for myself or angry with the World my life is not so bad
Till a young woman with a cheerful smile greeted me with a good day
And she spread her gift of happiness as she walked upon her way.

Buying a car today would be so nice!
Having a car thats old is quite alright;
Getting a car tomorrow would be wise!
Changing a car each day would not be right.
Having something thats old is good enough;
Having something today seems still better;
Having something tomorrow is quite tough;
Yet, satisfaction's prime that must matter.
Each thing in time has its advantages;
Postponement's not something you always do;
One shouldn't decide slowly or take ages;
All things have demerits and beauty too!
Yet, values old have stood the test of time!
And modern things don't make life more sublime!

If Success was Happiness
Then achievers would be glad
But look around and you will find
That many of them are sad
Of course, Achievement gives joy
And excitement, oh boy!
But when our need becomes our greed
To misery, this will lead
The whole world is chasing Success
Everyone wants achievement
Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose
There is no Contentment
Why do people want to succeed?
Why is everyone in a race?
The Truth is that we want to win
So that there is a smile on our face
But though we win, we are not glad
We have money, why are we sad?
Happiness is not money, the sages said
It's sleeping soundly when you are in bed
We hear of suicides in the homes of the rich
If they were Happy, then why this glitch?
Although they are achievers, this fact we know
They are not Happy, their face has no glow
If successful, but unhappy, what is the use?
Winning or smiling, what would you choose?
The purpose of Success is for us to be glad
What is the use of winning, if it makes us sad?
Happiness is something different, we learn
Not just money that we earn and burn
Happiness is built on a foundation of peace
Then we are blissful like waves in the seas
Look around at the people who are glad
They live in the moment, they are never sad
They don't swing from the future to the past
They are the ones whose Happiness lasts
Happiness has no price tag, know this my friend
It's a state of mind where nothing can offend
It's being able to smile, and able to laugh
Not just trying to raise our Success graph
We can't measure joy in dollar and pound
Happy is he who peace has found
Though we may fly the world around
We may be miserable on the ground
Success is not Happiness, this Truth we must know
We may have everything, what's the use of this show?
The truly successful one is he
Who lives with smile, laughter, and glee
If one is Happy, then one has achieved all
One doesn't have to be rich and in fame be tall
One can have little, but if content is he
Then he can live joyously
Achievement gives Happiness, this fact we know
But with Fulfilment and Contentment, does Happiness grow
One who is Happy, doesn't need to win
He has Peace and Joy without committing sin
Joy doesn't need a foundation of cash
One doesn't have to be rich, to enjoy life's bash
Happiness is a simple state of the mind
It comes from being loving, it comes from being Kind
Happiness is Success. It is achieving life's goal
It is being Happy in the heart, Peaceful in the Soul
True Happiness is eternal, not just a moment of joy
It last's forever, it can't be destroyed
Success is a journey of valleys and peaks
Life is a see-saw, there arelaughs and squeaks
Success, unlike Happiness, doesn't last for long
But the truly Happy ones always sing a Happy song
So, Success is not Happiness, Happiness is Success
You may be an achiever, whose heart is not at rest
But though not successful, if Happy you are
Then you are an achiever, you are the very best

and I felt alright when you kissing me goodnight.

I saw you passing by, I told you why the love
I cant deny, only that we are to far away.
every night every day, but if you will
open your heart and love me....
I swear I'll never make you cry.

There's a happiness, a joy
in one soul, that's been
buried alive in everyone
and forgotten.
It isn't your barroom joke
or tender, intimate humor
or affections of friendliness
or big, bright pun.
They're the surviving survivors
of what happened when happiness
was buried alive, when
it no longer looked out
of today's eyes, and doesn't
even manifest when one
of us dies, we just walk away
from everything, alone
with what's left of us,
going on being human beings
without being human,
without that happiness.
$
the irony of this pursuit is this:
the more you pursue it
the more it escapes
away from your grasp
you think your hands
finally catch
happiness, and you
hold on to it
tightly like you
are a bird with claws
like an eagle holding
on to the monkey
then blood drifts
on the holy mountains
the paradox lies
not in the taking of happiness
but in giving it away
and then the magic happens
the mountains dance
the caves open
and the rivers sing
it is clear, when you take it
you simply release it
then you are happy
and the pursuit is nothing
but
in simply the giving
the patience of waiting
like a tree whose fruits
are ripe where children
climb
gather the fruits
and chew and swallow
every sweetness of
the pulp,
the fiber
juice sliding smoothly
inside innocent their throats
$
Over the rainbow bluebirds scatter,
Nothing's there to really matter.
A shaft of light born of love,
From the womb of life
Pierces the axis of your being
Your home.
No need to climb that mountain,
No need for promised lands,
No need to climb that fence,
The shaft of light has told you,
You're sitting on a golden seat,
See,
Your Eden's.
Lying all around your feet.

Statistics tell.  You can be
independent of them, but
you cannot deny them.
Though white Americans are freed
from many of the hassles and indignities
that affect black Americans, yet,
on average, they are only
very slightly happier.
Men have more power and freedom
than women, yet, on average,
they are not any happier.
(Women experience more depression,
but also more intense joy..)
Though the young have so much more
to look forward to, than the elderly,
yet ratings of life satisfaction rise slightly
up to age sixty-five, and for some, beyond..
People in colder areas of the USA
might expect Californians to be
happier. They are wrong.
Surely people who are more attractive
are happier than the unattractive?
Not so..
If you’re adequately housed,
adequately clothed, adequately fed,
then wealth will surely bring you greater happiness?
The rich are only a very little
happier than the middle classes…
So is this the end of
The American Dream – Joe,
José, Leroy, Yusuf, Gianni, Johan, Boris, Ivan, Ravi?
isn’t there a happy ending, over the border,
over the ocean, over the rainbow?
Yes, there is…
happy people grow rich faster..

If happiness only lies
In a place we don't exist
And only future days
Are one’s we miss
If satisfaction never comes
And dreams are unattained
Then you sacrificed your happiness
And only you’re to blame
The moment that we’re living
Should be lived with no regret
Don't let reaching for the future
Have you to obsessed
Find happiness
While you have your health
The evidence from pleasing others is
You may not please yourself
$
Sharing each other’s hopes and dreams.
Caring about what happens to each other.
Respecting each other’s goals and ambitions.
Committing to share everything with each other.
Making decisions together like all good teams do.
Being there for the bad times as well as the good.
Trusting the other to do the right thing in the relationship.
Knowing each other so well that reacting becomes instinctive.
Believing the whole relationship is the sum of two halves together.
Loving each other for person they are, not the person they could be.
$
The warmth of the sun,
The touch of your hand,
The waves against my feet,
This is true happiness.
My father’s smile,
My mother’s laughter,
My brother’s love,
This is true happiness.
Making you laugh,
Making you smile,
Making you see that there’s more to me,
This is true happiness.
Doing this,
Writing,
Feeling, emoting,
This is true happiness.
Dancing, but not only dancing,
Giving it my whole, my being,
Becoming the dance,
This is true happiness.
Seeing your face when you realize
That I’m always me, with or without you.
Me realizing that I don’t need you.
This is true happiness.
$
Happiness is knowing,
that you are truly loved,
But that someone special.
Knowing that you are secure,
With the person you are,
Is also happiness.
Happiness is knowing,
that you have learned,
to believe, trust and most of all,
Love yourself, for the person that you are.
Having accomplished all that is needed,
to be a complete person on the inside,
Only then, can we be truly happy.
Being happy with ourselves,
We are ready to accept the happiness,
that awaits us in our lifetime,
And that is the greatest happiness of all.

Cut skin,
Matching Tattoos,
Alluring night,
Tantalizing moon,
Friends were on drugs
Sauntering down
The summer avenues,
Hands clasped tightly
By romantic youths
With sexual aspirations!
We made promises
To each other
Amid the madness
To remain
Tragically in love
And never change,
I wish we would have died
Back then
In our warped happiness.
$
A babe’s first cry, as she enters the world
Sobs of delight, greet this miracle of life
A child’s happy laugh, running free
Gasps of wonder, on making a discovery
That shy winsome giggle, on a first date
Silent conversations that leap beyond fate
A moan of delight when we soar together
When souls tenderly mingle, that hushed surrender
And that song between heartbeats
When a soulmate is near!
$
happiness
is bliss
happiness,
is when you get a new puppy
happiness,
is when you get married
happiness,
is when you go on you first date
happiness,
is making your own decisions
happiness,
is graduating
happiness,
is getting you first job
happiness,
is falling in love
happiness
is being proud of who you are
happiness
is bliss
happiness,
is glowing
happiness,
is fun
happiness,
is an amazing feeling
happiness,
is when you smile all day
happiness,
is giving someone a hug just because you can
happiness,
is that light in your eyes
happiness,
is what makes the world go around
happiness,
is bliss

Give and you shall receive
Plant and you shall harvest
Smile and smiles to you be extended
Help and you will be blessed.
It's a simple secret, known
in decades and centuries
in villages and cities
by simple folks and sages.
It's within the festival of lights
in Hanukkah of the Jews,
in Tihar or Diwali of the Hindus,
in Eid of the Muslims and
in Christmas of the Christians.
The secret of giving and sharing
is upheld, valued and celebrated.
Give happiness to others
and receive bountiful
happiness as blessing
you greatly deserve.

I awakened this morning,
With a happiness attack.
I wasn't sure what it was.
So I laid quietly on my back.
When I fell asleep last night,
I didn't expect to wake up...
Not like that!
And when I opened my eyes,
I was surprised to feel so good.
So the next thing I did,
Was to thank God...
Like I should!
Unexpectedly I received my 'gift',
Delivered from God...
As only God could!
I awakened this morning,
With a happiness attack.
I wasn't sure what it was.
So I laid quietly on my back.
Making sure it was not the nightmare...
Many have become addicted to share.
And I had left staring in disbelief,
That I was not grieving with it!
And leaving it there.
On the other side of my door,
Where it was abandoned...
The day before!
