Law of love?  Sounds good… so, tell me more…
Love of law?  mmm…maybe…not so sure…
You can disregard the ancients –
label them  Not Applicable – bin that bulky file…
or try to make some sense; and they insist
that love and law are so close intertwined
that together, they may tell
more than each other taken individually.
What might this mean? Where can we start?
Those ancients say that all this universe,
all this creation, is one single act of love;
love brings it forth, sustains it, nourishes it,
and so ultimately, it merges into love;
and by the laws of love,
which hold all forms by law,
our natural state is naught but love;
and knowing this, knows no injustice in ourself;
knows all as equal; knows no pressures nor compulsions;
knows no darkness; and no partiality or preferentiality;
and partaking of this universal love,
we’re therefore just, and light of heart,
and ready of response..
and so, this love, which knows ourself as love,
(for every creature's nature is pure love)
may love the laws which make our nature thus;
love the laws of love, and live as love;
so out of love, comes law;
and out of law, comes love.
only in this fleeting moment of the present
is our life lived;
and only if, in this continuous now,
love and law are present in each action,
may we make our golden future;
live a golden life, where law has made us free.
this, the ancients say; the proof is ours to live.

i wish to be the air you breathe
love that floods your every cell
revitalising you, cheering you up
every second of your life
i love like the rush of the Nile, Yangtze -
listen, listen to this lovelorn heart,
holding on, letting go, holding on
with such tenacity to the hope
of every lovelorn night
an eclipse helps distill
my love for you,
seals your charms, allure
from the craving prying eyes
of the world, precipitates that
momentuous silhouette,
escapade for me and you
sun and moon, yin and yang
to be totally absorbed
in bliss, in each other
love, love, love
if only i could be the only star
to win your fancy
for that sparkling while
heaven the world would become

love, oh what is love?
flowers in so many shapes and hues
giving sweetness  to butterflies and bees
in so many shapes and hues
in the field, a buzz, a joy, these insects
help create another world
another paradise, warm colourful  flower garden
for lovers of the world
help spread cheers everywhere
with the sweetness  the flowers
where the flowers are, the butterflies, the bees are
where there is love, joy spreads
wide as the field
just look at the butterflies and the bees
how they cheer up  the field with their  songs and dance

Before you arrived
Love was just a four letter word
You gave definition

My heart is a wanderer in love
May it ever remain so
Roaming in the pathless land
In a caravan
Just going where the winds blow...
Sometimes rendered miserable
Blown in all directions
In search of my eternal love fable
Inspite of all defections
Always singing the song of love....
Longing for the moon
Searching in the dunes
Will only be still when it becomes crystal
That there is no breath left
For me to fulfill.....

Beware, my Love
Of the thunder
That we will encounter
When we touch
Beware, my love
Of the Rain
The outpourings of the pain
For the lost time
Beware, my love
Of the lightning
The resurrection that it will bring
Of our dormant desires
Beware, my Love
Of the flood
The mingling of our blood
When our skins dissolve
Beware, my Love
Of the reverbration
The resounding celebration
Of Our eternal Embrace

Well, honey it is January
And soon it will be February
I know what it reminds me
To remember you in Valentine's Day
And I know what is that day for
And I know what it is for
The love of love for all love
The love of love for sweetheart of
But we been sweetheart since then
My love for you ain't been forgotten
Though we have this strands of silver hair
Valentine's Day is nothing for me as I always care
And my love is always fresh like the morning
With our love still blending and refreshing
And refreshes my mind everyday
Not only on Valentine's Day

(love is like)
Love is like a painting
filled with all colours and shades
love is like a bleeding heart
cut with many sharp blades
love is like a never ending story
that always begins with a kiss
love is like a space everlasting
that fills bitterness with bliss
love is like the circle of eternity
always there to take for free
(love is)
Love is an open clear pool
where no hate can dare swim
love is a captured sunset
where the warmth never grows dim
love is desire held in the eye
that spreads quickly to the heart
love is a black starry night sky
a metaphor of glorious art
love is a deep dark hole of mystery
always there to take free

so there you are in
your pram or kiddikarria
nicely tucked up,
being talked to in that
singysongylingo
that grown-ups grow down to
when that tingylingy, like
that stoopid thingy
dangling on your cot that
doesn't do anything else
goes hissdidahdidah
and she switches her attention instantly
from who's mommy's little treasure then,
sticks this silver thing to block her ear
and starts talking to thin air
it must be either the fairies
who don't seem to be very helpful -
'oh darling don't say you forgot I
asked you specially...'
or she's going doolally and
the adult world's not
what it's cracked up to be
I'll give her two minutes no more
or else

I remember that day when we came to know each other
We had a good chat and shared with all our views
That day and night, I could not sleep and kept on watching
all those stars in the sky and thinking of you
The moments we shared were so special and unforgettable
You were so shy and young to say or do anything about it
I felt that I was in love with you
I want to tell you that how much I love you
I want to tell you what I feel for you
I want to tell you that when I think of you my heart twist inside
But at that time I thought it was to soon to tell you
Since I was working in another city, I could not meet you
My days have past with your loving thoughts
I was counting my days to get back to you
and tell you what was stored in my mind for only you
I felt my warm of love with you would melt the winter snows
Suddenly I received a message from your friend
that you had an accident and died in the hospital
I was so shocked and a tear runs down my cheek
My dream with you was shattered and everything
I believed is not here, you have gone to heaven
I know deep in my soul that I will not see you until it's my time
Before I start my love with you, I have lost my love
Now I sit all alone in my room as memories unfold
May be you might hear my cry and beating of my heart in pain forever
I miss you my love where ever you are always

Birds sing "I love you, love" the whole day through,
And not another song can they sing right;
But, singing done with, loving's done with quite,
The autumn sunders every twittering two.
And I'd not have love make too much ado
With sweet parades of fondness and delight,
Lest iterant wont should make caresses trite,
Love-names mere cuckoo ousters of the true.
Oh heart can hear heart's sense in senseless nought,
And heart that's sure of heart has little speech.
What shall it tell? The other knows its thought.
What shall one doubt or question or beseech
Who is assured and knows and, unbesought,
Possesses the dear trust that each gives each.

LOVE for love, and moments sweet,
Lips returning kiss for kiss,
Word for word, and eyes that meet;
Breath for breath, and bliss for bliss.
Thus at eve, and thus the morrow!
Yet thou feeblest, at my lay,
Ever some half-hidden sorrow;
Could I Joseph's graces borrow,
All thy beauty I'd repay!

C for you to see
P for you to Pray
G for you to Guide

Your not here with me my love,
so I hold my pillow to my chest
and make believe its you.
I kiss it twice, just the way
we used to do.
Your not here with me my love,
but I hold my pillow very
tight, pretending that its you.
I kiss it twice just the way
we used to do.
Your not here with me my love,
but somehow I felt
you knew... exactly what I'd do.
I'd kiss it twice just the way
we used to do.
Because our love is eternal
there's nothing left to say,
except to say this one last word.
I love you more each day.

Falling in love with love,
There's nothing like this,
Become like someone you love,
Is what I hope for and miss.
My love is lonely tonight,
When the stars shine on so bright,
What is for me now right,
Is perhaps all out of sight?
Falling for someone like you,
Is it just impossible?
Why is my heart so blue?
Am I just another fool?
The night is ascending,
Dark hours coming in soon,
My wishes comprehending
In shadows from the moon.
Falling in love with love,
There's nothing like this,
Become like the one you love,
Is it impossible to wish?
Now in this gleaming light,
Perhaps I've lost my flight,
But I shall hold on so tight,
Never give up on that fight.

My love is like an ocean
It goes down so deep
My love is like a rose
Whose beauty you want to keep.
My love is like a river
That will never end
My love is like a dove
With a beautiful message to send.
My love is like a song
That goes on and on forever
My love is like a prisoner
It’s to you that I surrender.

keeper of my heart
love me as long as i live

Hard is the love couples share as they try to reveal the love they share-
The words aren't there, hard to find, hard to seek. Love is hard and also blind when you try to hide,  and when you know its there.
Love is hard the up and downs, highs and lows, tares and snares
Hard to show and let them know the ones who know nothing about you
or the ones you can't stand are the ones who you should love
If you had show some form of love that one person you needed, was not
there now you are should've, could've, would've
because there was no love in your heart, hard love is the main thing of -
this world we live in
Love is hard in the place we call earth, Love isn't found not from
our indiviual peers, but from the citizens of America
Harder is love, hate comes easy
Is love hard because we don't know how or is love harder because
we don't care?
Love is blind- which is hard, hard to give, or hard to recieve
Which is harder Love or Hate?
I say love because we know its there but we simply ignore the presence of love, and hide in the darkness of the shadows of the issues of the world, only to hope on the light of LoVe.

I do not love you except because I love you;
I go from loving to not loving you,
From waiting to not waiting for you
My heart moves from cold to fire.
I love you only because it's you the one I love;
I hate you deeply, and hating you
Bend to you, and the measure of my changing love for you
Is that I do not see you but love you blindly.
Maybe January light will consume
My heart with its cruel
Ray, stealing my key to true calm.
In this part of the story I am the one who
Dies, the only one, and I will die of love because I love you,
Because I love you, Love, in fire and blood.

If love were like water
I'd build you a fountain,
And if love were like stone
I'd bring you a mountain.
If love were like air
I'd set whirlwinds free,
But as these are not love
I'll just give you me.

I read her to see her
And see her to perceive her.
Perceive that her mind touch
I love more, she thinks of  ‘much’.
O prisoner of time
Love has a rhythm love has a rhyme!
I love to love her not to love
In the space there no down no above!
See the cutaneous sensation, see see
Oh sweet the lil boy propel pee-pee!
I love to love her not to love
In the space there no down no above!
Who is she?
She is she plus he!
Pouring sun moon star flower in her words she comes to me to say- I want stay naked alike not a jaybird so that all onlooker can say I am not unclothed. And I know, enclothing because of unclothing!
I love to love her not to love
In the space there no down no above!
Cryptic affinity it is that we in love not to love!
**((‘She is she plus he’! -All of he and she has their own sweet recourse in their subconscious which is instinctive that seems linked up he and she and vice versa. Isn’t it?))

I love you because I love you...
and because I love you, I hate you!
and from hating you,
I love you more than  my own life
I love you because I love you,
and because I love you, I hate you.!
I hate you when you are morning sadness
but I love you when you are night happiness
I love you because I love you,
and because I love you, I hate you!
I hate you when you want to be what you are not
in the cold dawns,
but I love you like you are
in the hot nights of the cheerful summer.
I love you because I love you,
and because I hate you, I love you.! !
I love you because you have
the mischievous boy's infinite happiness
lost in the rain of the afternoon,
but I hate you when the gloom floods you.
I hate you because I love you,
and because I love you, I hate you !
I love you because you have the sensibility
and the fondness contained in a loving tear,
but I hate you when you are a lot of hidden memories.
I love you because I love you,
and because I love you, I hate you !
I love you because you are divine engineering,
but I hate you because I don't deserve you at the nightfall.
I love you because I love you,
and because I hate you, I love you! !
I love you because you are my life,
but I hate you because you are my death
and in the face of this great dilemma
I will die hating you...
to resuscitate loving you! !

Take a look at my poem, Spontaneous Generation
$
Of all of God's creation
I love you foremost
Tower of inspiration
And kindness utmost
Providing motivation
Giving me support
Helping ease frustration
With friendly comfort
I'm frozen by your beauty
Melted with your touch
In your arms I long to be
I love you so much
Even after many a year
The love of my life
You're the one I hold most dear
Blest you are my wife
Written for and dedicated to my beautiful wife, who I now understand why, I wish both you and I would have known, but it was all for the best, it was all part of His plan. I'm sorry, forgive me.

Here sits a boy so in love with this girl,
But he won't say a word cause it sets him in a whirl.
And it won't stop spinning untill he can find
some rest, reassurance or peace of mind,
That this girl that he loves so very much wil be in his arms
to hold and touch.
All that he wants is for this girl to caress
But he can't possibly cause his heads such a mess.
And he desperatley longs and hopes for the day that he can openly but honestly say,
'i love you more than anythingelse, even more than life itself'.

It's been hours now just laying in bed
Almost time to get up for work but only your in my head
I'm laughing at myself for wishing for the same fantasy
Of you finally choosing you really want to be with me
Every second I relive the moments I had with you
Enjoying every second I heard I love you too
It's been forever since a smile has ever lasted on my face
Because no other has ever come close to every taken your place
At times it seems pointless like we were never meant to be
But then there are times I should just wait and see
I still wait and hang on to a slim glimpse of hope
Because losing you was something I just couldn't cope
Years have past with it seasons came and went
With thoughts of you my sleepless nights i spent
Even to this day I still remember our first kiss
It's still you I love it's your love I will always miss
$
Your beauty overwhelms me
As I wrap my arms around you
I press your softness tight
Great passion fills my inner being
I'm captured in your embrace
Your eyes control my very soul
The touch of your lips, heaven
Forever frozen in time
All else fades into nothing

Through all the injustice making life not fair,
the world is choking, gasping for air.
Even though people differ in color, beliefs, and tongues,
we all have love in our hearts and air in our lungs.
When all we do is discriminate,
all that shows is the evils of mans hate.
To reverse this world-wide tragedy,
people have to stop and realize that their acting like gravity.
Breaking people down like a dictator of hate,
the world works for the rich with no debate.
behind every cheap dollar top,
there is a child wasting away in a third-world shop.
Engraved in the treads are the blood and tears,
of the little children expressing their fears.
Although we think that this could not be true,
the world works so shady, not caring what other people must go through.

Void, empty, hollow inside
My dreams have fled, my hopes have died
Existence has no reason
Life's just passing with each season
She was my life, my hope, my love
All is gone, passed by thereof
The hurt is such no one should bear
What's to life, why should I care?
I weep all night for my love gone
My heart is sick, for death I long
Mine eyes well tears for love that's lost
I'll mourn always for the great cost
But in each day Lord give me hope
Strengthen me so I may cope
Grant me wisdom to help me see
Thy great way and not just me.

The time will come
when, with elation
you will greet yourself arriving
at your own door, in your own mirror
and each will smile at the other's welcome,
and say, sit here. Eat.
You will love again the stranger who was your self.
Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart
to itself, to the stranger who has loved you
all your life, whom you ignored
for another, who knows you by heart.
Take down the love letters from the bookshelf,
the photographs, the desperate notes,
peel your own image from the mirror.
Sit. Feast on your life.

Loss can be good for us,
researchers say (Nolen-Hoeksema
and Davis,2002)   – it’s called
Post-Traumatic Growth…
When we ‘lose’ someone
we seldom see these days,
yet always love, we are in some strangely beautiful way
the gainers –
lose someone who, caught a glimpse of
down a school corridor, is like
a mirror in which you’ll see reflected
yourself as nothing but pure love…
and when you meet her then, it’s just as if
you meet love – and a modesty almost uncertain:
as if she had been  bestowed the awesome gift
of a part of sun and sunlight, and told,
bestow this wisely…
warmth, and light, and beautiful humility –
even your great talent – I recall
a rare and radiant press review
of a concert in the Purcell Room
where you improvised on, was it, Ravel..?
and when asked why you never built
upon that boost, you said with typical
serious thought, well people don’t seem
to be interested in that sort of thing…
so, the occasional concert; and another
undeveloped gift, for bringing together in opera
people who would never have dared
to seek the gift of singing in themselves…
so, we the gainers in this sad yet joyful way:
we saw you just occasionally; now,
as often as we remember you,
you’re here again, as love.. just, love…
my only sadness, Jennifer,
is that one day, when on your face
(never tell a lady to her face
about her face – yet I insult you
by saying that of you…)
on your face I saw the look
of a little girl who’d done her very best,
yet feared retribution…what demon,
small or large, had you to deal with in yourself?
I regretted then, not speaking out
and asking you about that; yet
you, with your great talent to bring love
were better equipped than I; too wise,
I think, not to know yourself…
for what you brought in your sweet nature –
taking work where it would offer,
playing the piano for a celebrated
but also modest ballet teacher,
playing a white grand piano next to a fern
in Heathrow’s nerve-strained hall…
what you brought was the essence of
that Indian ‘Perfect Prayer’ which so many speak
but not all live out: that nothing can be ‘taken’,
for the remainder is always perfect…
so we will mourn, or celebrate, dear Jenny:
we who were so fortunate,
and who shall remain  blessed for ever
that you have lived on earth..
‘sweet are the uses of adversity’ – for
there’s music in our souls

Your eyes in my heart,
vast, deep, bluish,
a sweet breeze now touches
the brain, heart, mind and soul,
alluring lips
whisper in my ears again
the depth of your love
as the stars dappled stream flows
not disturbing anybody
reflecting its beauty ever,
wings of love, beauty and eternity
merge into one,
when? from where?
I don't know, sure,
I have got a bit of
soft spot for you and the apple of your eyes,
now, the ring on your little finger,
giggling bangles encircling the wrist,
light green vein on your soft hand
near the silver wrist watch,
swaying earrings stroking the cheek
appear more beautiful,
birds, flowers, butterflies,
life on the earth,
grass, galaxies, time and infinity,
my mind recollects all these...
Moses and Ten Commandments,
the Bible, the Qur'an, the Gita...
rationalists, communists, atheists...
Darwin, Freud, Newton,
Magellan, Copernicus, Shakespeare,
Van Gogh, Charles Chaplin,
E equals MC squared,
cloning, IT...
pianissimo, play on...
dreams...
an innocent smile
on the face of a child,
tears of a neglected old mother,
a rose lying near the tomb in silence
with scattered tears on the petals,
sleep, death, darkness...
why did I come here?
who sent me here?
where am I going after death?
there is life beyond the grave?
for whom do I wake up in the morning?
why the creations are in pairs: male and female?
why does nature bind me with your eyes?
why does nature allow your eyes
to pierce me so deep?
two doves ruffle their feathers
on the branches near the green leaves,
the sky kisses the ocean
making ripples and waves on its breast,
electrons keep their smartness
near the protons,
day and night play hide and seek,
Tajmahal blazes in the evening rays
pulsating the loveever...
the stars wink at each other
during theirtravel in the space,
moonlight touches the petals of lotus
in romance,
now the pregnant clouds pour,
the flowers and fruits delight the soul,
now, no prejudices,
no narrow domestic walls,
but love
your eyes
vast, deep, bluish...

and right now, I’m spending most of my time
on the two matters of which I seem to know the least –
love; and poetry.
maybe it’s good I feel like this; after all,
they’re two pretty big things in their way;
and if it’s frustrating that
I don’t seem to get anywhere,
or understand any more,
maybe that’s good too since
it keeps me at it
and out of harm’s way
as they say
let’s take poetry first – that’s
relatively straightforward:
one day I love the freedom
of the current situation – there’s no rules
except, the lines are short –
but even that, you can break
with ‘prose poems’ (and leave it
to others to say when 'prose poems'
become ‘poetic prose’ etc…) :
tell the unvarnished truth,
tell it like it is; offer all your heart
ungiftwrapped;
then next day I miss the music
of a poem that – with some difficulty –
rhymes and dances in its rhythms,
catches you in its woven spell,
reads as if it wrote itself,
sings its own fair song,
even though of course
the rhyme then makes you deviate
from the theme – but that can take you to
more interesting places in the mind —
so - point of this - I’m none the wiser
about what poetry is; though of course
maybe there’s some benefit I just don’t spot
by kinda mixing thisnthat..
so, when I’m not writing this stuff
that I call poetry, if I call it anything,
I’m addressing the question
of love; in the hope
that thinking about it might just be
of some use; influence action; and
make me more loving; or help me
write poetry about it, ha..
well don’t ask me, not just yet..
though, we all know what love is...
when it’s on our side?
one day, I feel good that I’ve spent the day
reading inspiring words, like,
the whole Creation is one single act
of love; that it brought the whole universe
into manifestation; sustains it; merges all things into love;
that love is knowledge; holds all forms
through law, by law; that law and love
are always together; that love’s
the natural state of ourself; that
every creature has pure love within its nature;
that thus, it’s our very nature
to love one another; love
our neighbour as ourself…
even, love ourselves...
then the next day, I can’t bear
to read any more of what’s written
about love; just spend the day in love
with everything and everyone;
being still a little, listening to music a little,
reading inspiring poetry a little,
going out or not going out,
being just myself a lot; seeing things around
inside the house and out
so vividly, it’s like being high
without the before and after, and
I wonder why it isn’t
always just like this..
then the next day again, I’m just too busy
to give thought to thinking about love,
or being loving to those bloody neighbours
then the doorbell rings – and
I greet whoever it is before
I even look at them, as if
they’re the one person out of all the world
I most wanted to see again right now – and
it’s someone to read the meter –'hallo!
what, again so soon? I’ve only just paid
the last bill, and anyway, it always comes
as ‘estimated’, and too high…'
too late – I’ve loved them totally
in that first moment; I'm like
someone else; I find myself
treating them like an honoured guest;
see them out with a friendly comment; feel good;
a sorta indifferent, unthought, unshaped happiness..
maybe there’s something to be discovered
in all this love thing,
whatever it is.. maybe
I’ll go try to write a poem about it,
see where it goes
[This poem is dedicated to the memory of Bukowski, the poet
who taught us to write it like it is - even if his later work...]
$
We do not have to seek for love
nor fear it ever go:
but simply, rest within ourself;
then, love perforce must flow:
for who’s the sweetest company,
as parent, sister, brother?
Those restful ones, always themself;
as one who knows no other..
*
[This came after watching ‘The Big Sing’:
every seat in the Albert Hall taken
by those singing their hearts out
to fine words; while simultaneously and
in unsought parallel, love flowed..]
$
For thy heart beats of pain.
For it yearns for love
Yet, love is not on the scale
of gain.
For thy heart is slowly beating
away..
For the cries and heartache
seems to never end
For it is here to stay.
Through thy hidden fears..
only thy cries speaks very
loudly.
For at one time..it was disguised
with smiles very proudly.
Yet, no one seems to notice the pain
that grows inside of thee.
For thy have kneeled on thines
knees..asking...
'is this how it's gonna be? '
Trust
Devotion
and Love is not in the picture,
For trine heart is broken and
crushed into different measures and
mixtures.
For how thy pray to the heavens for
love.
For one can only wait for the
answer  from way up above.
For thy love being in love....
but ones discovered that love don't
love thee.
For time has passed..love seems to
hide from thee.
How can this be?
For one feels that love is not meant
for thee.
Hoping
Wishing
and Praying that love is for thee.
Hopefully a miracle will come and
open thy eyes..So thy can see that
love is there for thee.
But until then...thy' Love Being In Love..
But Love Don't  Love Thee.'
The End!
$
Even In sleep the old man weeps,
his heartbeat a throb, love gone - love gone.
Each moment too long since he held her tight,
swaying heart to cheek to his favourite song.
He carries the burden of mournful flight,
swooping and gliding - the highs - the lows.
To tearfully soak through the solace of wit,
whistle through lungs and in-between toes.
Day after day the old man weeps,
his footsteps echo -  love gone - love gone.
The sun burns an imprint of dust on his face
There is no-one to lay his heart down upon.
At dusk unfamiliar shadows brush past.
he curses the moon so whole and bright.
screams - at the stars that continue to shine.
asks again, and again, who gave them the right.
One night in his bed the old man slept
his pulse wants to race love gone - love gone,
Then a peaceful smile crept over his face,
and he willed himself follow, go on - go on.

Love
is found;
enraptured
are two, then shared
are understanding
and trust entwined with truth.
Defined are dreams and romance;
aroused are emotions inside;
whenever destiny is working.
~~~**~~~
Working is destiny whenever
inside emotions are aroused.
Romance and dreams are defined.
Truth with entwined trust and
understanding are
shared, then two are
enraptured;
found is
love.
$
Love is the coin in the fountain
The wish that’s never granted
Love is the night sky that has more stars than you need
But less stars than you want
Love is that story that doesn’t have a clear ending
And no matter what you do, you can’t imagine a happy one
Love is that sky with only a single cloud
And just when you need the sunlight it creeps in front of the sun
And the light goes out
Love is that mark on you
The one you were born with
Want to get rid of
But wouldn’t be the same without
Love is that little tree standing lonely on field
You always think it’s in the way
But really it makes the field what it is
Love is the sand on the beach
Alone a grain of sand is nothing
Together it’s everything
Love is the river
It may look calm and still
But the truth is it never really stops
And you can never step in the same river twice
Love is what makes me write this poem….its what makes you read it
It’s the gravity that holds you down
And the air that can raise you up
It’s the force that moves you
And the wall that makes you stop
Its way you live
And the reason you want to die
But it’s also the reason you keep holding on
It’s the hope that gives us miracles
And the bad times that make you appreciate the good.
Its way I love you guys you see….
And the way you guys love me…

_________Author's Prologue____________
Originally written for my (then) 12 year old daughter
on her challenge for me to write a rhyming poem in
less than ten minutes, with a love theme story line to
boot... this is what I was able to conjure up. As a rule
I am not a great fan of rhyming poetry, tho' I have
written some over the years. However, in this one
special case I must admit indulging in my daughter's
challenge...and was very glad that I took her up on it.
Now,24, she still rides me now and again in how she
conned me into writing a rhyming love poem! It was on
the PH Top 500 Poems List from 2006-2012(topping out at
#68) in 2007. Unfortunately, the work was accidently deleted by me,
so, I thought I'd resurrect it one more time...........FjR
..................................... ................................................. .
LOVE...Is...LOVE...Is...LOVE...
I t's the kiss......before the goodnight
It's the bliss after dimming the light
It's the memories....of special day's
It's the tempering.....clouds of grey
It's the turn.....of one's other cheek
It's the silence before the arm reach
It's the excitement of your first date
It's the enlightenment..... you create
It's the shoes...you leave at the door
It's the muse.....you call your amour
It's the sharing.....of wine and seeds
It's the caring...to honor and please
It's the start of your day's in the sun
It's the hearts of 2......that beat as 1
It's the diamond shopping...at Kay's
It's the roses........on Valentine's Day
It's the sunset.......you nestled under
It's the lightning.....'fore the thunder
It's the morning they call 'The After'
It's the yawning.....and the laughter
It's the healing.......of passions scars
It's the feeling its cures' in the heart
It's the action of words..you profess
It's the passion.......and nothing less
It's the passion.......and nothing less

LOVE IS
Always good mannered, bears up under stress
Looks for ways to be kindly, is quick to confess.
LOVE IS NOT
Ever possessive, nor needs to impress.
Not touchy, nor jealous if it seems to get less.
LOVE IS
Looking to share, and hopes for good things.
Knows no limits to taking what life sometimes brings
LOVE IS NOT
Proud or boastful, it does not feel revoked
By injuries suffered, nor is it provoked.
LOVE IS
Decent, believing, looking for good.
Contented, yet happy when misunderstood.
It's trusting, and hoping, as love always should.
Thus love begets love. It personifies God.
Lets hold  up the feelings we deem to call Love.
Comparing them close in the light of above.
$
I can not fathom, the reasons
nor understand the significance
why does love just blossoms
in the garden of the heart's stance
and grows abundantly
at any given chance
Love I suppose, is freedom
of the heart and soul
It exists to sooth boredom
and brings zest to all
No matter what it does
Its nativity is a call
For love is love
Boundless and true
$
Every one is each love
Some thing...
Some budy love god
Some budy love butterfly's
Some budy love dog's
Some budy love sex...!
Some budy love painting'S
Some budy love money
Somebudy something love
The life...
Something is hear
Many thing and anything
Love the men and women's
For life day's
Life is a not  for life
Heart of love love
All ways love love....!
$
She took away my fears
and opened my heart
like a letter
and found written
Love, love and love
all over.
$
Love is the salt, in the life-meal
If you taste it unsalted, many times hurt you feel
Love is something real, you cant pretend
If you have no feelings, give it an end
Love is a combination, that join two
Makes them one with passion true
Love is to feel good with all your deeds
When the phrase 'crazy change' your life leeds
$
How do you write a poem
about Love?
It cannot be caught
and is beyond words’
power of depiction.
It has no place to be,
all places are filled
with Love.
Without Love would
anything have any savour?
Love is what joins
Love is what flows
Love is what counts
Love is what grows
Love is what’s known.
Love is all around
Love is all about
Love is all we ask
Love is all we give
Love is all I have.
Love wants nothing
Love needs nothing
Love misses nothing
Love excludes nothing
Love is what this is all about.
Joining, flowing, counting,
growing, knowing
around, about
asking, giving, having
All is Love,
of that I have no doubt.
$
Love love love love and if love is okay,
I know love is there to makes you grow,
I know also lack of love makes you decay.
$
Love, love, love!
Is very special
And so warm
Because it is
A feeling
That comes
Out from our hearts
That we give
To the ones that
We love and cherished
The most in our lives
$
From east to west from north to south
Let all creation find
That truth is always in our mouth
And peace is on our mind
Let’s live our lives to others now
Let’s touch The Father’s heart
To Jesus let our knees but bow
From evil take no part
Until the world’s is Satan free
Till Jesus reigns supreme
Let’s help our blinded neighbours see
That life is not a dream
Let empathy become our creed
Compassion wear a crown
Plant in the world a thoughtful seed
Bedecked with selfless gown
To fellow man, do no more wrong
Our neighbours cause no ruin
Let love become our living song
And dance alone its tune
However high we pay the price
Let love become our guide
Let hate become our sacrifice
On altars far and wide
Its love its love its always love
That melts a heart of stone
So let its fruit from God above
Transform our flesh and bone
Let neighbours see the joy within
Love’s fruit give free to eat
Encourage them to walk from sin
And sit at Jesus feet
$
Oh it's so easy to say -
'Give what you think you lack -
You feel unloved? Then give love, and love, and love...'...
On the other hand -
Do you have any better advice?

Love is not

a white flag of surrender

Love, love, love...
Thanks goes to the all mighty one from up above.
You've brought my mate just to my side...
You've led the spiritual path for your son's holy guided stride.
He gave up his life for your good holy loved wide spread word...
Many people were forgiven,
of this fact forgiven ex-sinners have world widely heard.
Fate united me to my bride...
Cupid's arrow gave me such a wonderful wild crazy ride.
Thank God...
Amen!

White says love me
Never, Ever, Never

White gives peace
White gave me pollution
White sowed purity
White spoiled my chastity.
White is superior
It made me inferior
White is cultured
It destroyed my culture.
White is all
Who said this all
You, its only you
Not I, never will I.
White says love me
I say I don't

Because you ruled at my own.

I once wrote some poetry - the best,
the finest POETRY
My POETRY came with a capital
"P".
My POETRY was distinguished
POETRY, proper, complete line of
Verse POETRY - honorable,
prehistoric, geographical POETRY
Divine, instinctive, even religious
POETRY -
I sent it to the magazines
The very good magazines
The very best magazines -
They returned it to me every time!
I once wrote some inferior POETRY
Low in style, irregular in measure
POETRY
Undignified, trivial, absurd POETRY
inadequate, mischievous, comic
POETRY
Some stuff like this - A CRIME -
I sent it to the magazines
The very good magazines
The very best magazines
They kept it every time!
Now, I ask of you - my question is
fair and brief - I ask
Of you - your ear I pray and beg you
give -
Shall I write intuitive,
comprehensive, reasoning
POETRY
Specific, Godlike, Capitol
committed POETRY
The sort I think will live?
Or shall I write inferior, very bad
POETRY - the kind that soon is
Dead - and send it to the magazines,
the very good, the best magazines
THAT I MAY LIVE INSTEAD!!!

Love oh love is everywhere
Like inside my dream,
Here and there yesteryear
Puffing up lofty stream;
Spring is once again near
With morning so plentiful,
Winter on its underwear
The last of the frosty jewel.
Love oh love is coming now
Blooms soon starting to show,
Worries die out somehow
With the last winter's blow;
Give me a hope in the living
That will follow a sunny day,
There is so much worth giving
In the beginning of new May.
Love oh love is here to share
With wonderful thing to be,
To heal the old shallow arr
That once were here adoptee;
Spring's again nearly born
Filling my longings and wish,
What in earth ways I adorn
I can't be without all this.

This is a LOVE poem about all the poems I love, about love, poems...
All who have tasted the finest love,
speak the same language.
It can be recognized by the heart!
All this music, of love-poetry we play,
a beauteous symphony,
felt by whom? ignored by most,
we host truth.
All other verse that resonates not,
comes from brilliant, intellectual thought.
Do you want to read about Barbecued ribs, or EAT them?
Even if I describe them well?
Their tenderness and juicy smell...
Do you want to learn about love
and then pass-on your knowledge?
Sounding like you are learned and
right the hell out of college!
Or...
Get roped and dragged in, beaten...
Then nursed and recover,
from loves first round with you?
Not yet even have you had a taste!
Little do you know it will SLAY YOUR SOUL, left to bitter WASTE!
Young ones you love
and passionate you are,
but it is a bar game
or in the back of a car.
The love that is real,
is the love that may kill you,
rip you to shreds
and your guts it will spill you!
From the top of the mountain
to the bottom of the pit,
You will crash down after flying
and be done with that $#it!
From that flight on fire
and the crash so violent,
that is from where the spark re-bursts ~ forth,
before the fuel re-ignites...
I'll leave it there, a common language amongst lovers,
a total mystery to those who seek love under covers!
$
Soft and warm
Sealed with care
Sweet and kind
Will ever share
Brave and strong
Yet so fair
That is her
She's always there
Sensitive
to despair
Harkens to
others welfare
Delicate
she's elsewhere
Beautiful
beyond compare
If you meet her
Best Beware
She'll steal your heart
unaware
Her name is Love
This I swear
There's none like her
anywhere
love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love

Love's Beautiful
I was scared of love -
love was a slap in the face
when I did something wrong
and it got to mom
love is a chase and breaking
my favourite stuff
When parents gave love
they spiced it with hate
when friends gave love
they set conditions and rules
when you love me
is it duty-free -
what is the dividends?
You reminded me how
I completely withdrew
from all forms of life
and lived in a book
so much so that closing the book
stopped me breathing and being
only words on paper
words in a song, music playing
was existence for me...
Feed me love
to fill my cup
with loving feelings
that I can carry with me
wherever I go -
I didn't trust mom
when I was small
and since then
I didn't trust men
I discovered
my father’s love
but recently
he is violent but true
never lies to you
Are you a dream -
whatever the reality
love's a beautiful
phenomenon…
Love Still Untainted
Listening to Mozart’s Piano Concerto*
on the radio – violins are the light
of stars flickering, shimmering, the
piano says of the birth of a beautiful
love in the heart of a man; maimed in
its manifestation by callous hands,
its beauty never reaching the heart
of the beloved one. That love is still
untainted and as sweet as this lovely
composition: will the love of my father
for my mother endure until its revelation
in the life hereinafter –
enduring unto eternity…?
*Concerto No.21 in C
Love Unassuming For M.C.K.
And then you came
and spoke about consideration
and I thought: Where's warm love?
and spoke about alienation
and I thought: Where's the passion?
and focused on doing the right thing
and consistency and loyalty and quiet love
and I thought: What is that thing
called love that is so unassuming?
I thought love was all-consuming...
and that after the fire had burnt out
nothing would remain
but your love kept on burning
with a pure and beautiful flame
and awakened such  sweet love in me
filled me with such a feeling of security
that left my blighted youth behind
so that today I find
I love you even more than before
Love a Scorpion & Needs Of Another
To Love A Scorpion
I used to cry
when you stung me
with your honesty
and angry attacks
I thought if you
loved me, you would
not be angry with me
for being fearful and scared
Then I read
people show their love
differently,  there are
codes of love – when we
understand the character
of a loved one, we’ll be
able to discern the love
clothed in idiosyncrasy
When I saw your
Astrogenetic sign:
Scorpio – with the sting
in the tail; it is your
nature to be brutally
honest, to judge mercilessly,
a light went on for me:
a Scorpion’s love does entail
merciless attack, not for lack
of love; but because of it -
without love, you destroy completely
with love, you are authoritative
Difficult as it may be
I love my Scorpion
together we soar
you’re an eagle – when you’re glad
Together we crawl
in the dust – when you’re sad
together we burn up
in the heat of your anger
but like the phoenix
we rise again – reborn
after your emotional storm:
Now I know
your code of love
and why you attack,
I can deal with it
in a new way – and
my Astrogenetic sign
gives me permission
to cry enough
to wash all the pain
away!
Make Way For The Needs Of Another
Nobody said relationships were easy -
we are both in love with love, though
you cannot cope with the quick ebb and
flow of my emotions – your feelings
change slowly  while mine are in flux –
I keep my pose when dealing with you;
not wishing to rock the boat – sometimes
regretting that I can’t be me – but then,
I have poetry to write it all down, deal with
the sting of jealousy, manipulation and
arrogance – and woe is me when I point
out these traits – so let’s keep the peace;
I’m proud of the way you pursue these
demons of yours - fighting relentlessly;
weighing pros and cons we can make things
work; please do not be so unforgiving; let’s
make room for the failings of others, let’s
visit the Queen of Hearts and my sister the
Duchess someday; let’s start with a
clean slate and make way for the
needs of another...

he offered her all the treasures that she desired
if only she could put out his fire.
the fire that was in his soul
was starting to burn out of control.
but! of him she did not want any part
for she was in love with another
and this man was his brother.
his love so deep, and so profound
he let out a scream, without a sound.
seeing the way she looked at his brother
he knew then, that there would be no other.
his love for both, was so strong
that he knew, together they belonged.
so with his heart in his hand
he decided to make a plan,
to show them that they belonged together
and through marriage, their life
would be better.
now they both knew, that his
heart was broken
but! another word was never spoken.
he had shown them that his love
was strong enough, to endure the pain.
and that their love, should be the same.
unknowingly this was part of GODS plan
to see the love that he had within
given up for love of his brother.
the LORD already had a new love, on her way
and forever in his heart she would stay.
so on his brothers wedding day
a beautiful woman passed his way.
eyes so deep, hair so black
he almost caught a panic attack.
and as their eyes met, and their
hearts slowed down its pace.
he knew that it was the end of the race.
for now they both had the love they desired
and she would be the one
to put out his fire.

Am I sick cos I hate to hate you,
You made me hate you,
Let myself hate you,
When it's all your fault,
...Cos you made me love you,
Yeah you made me hate to love you,
Now I hate myself.
So twist through time,
If you ever look back...
Admit you used me like the other damn Jacks!
So all that time you were lying?
All that time I was a fool?
Now this time I lay dying,
Drowning in this apathy pool,
These salted tears the gullable shed,
Well I've shed mine,
With guilt and dread,
Hear the voices,
Conscience in my head,
Now I can't trust it,
My conscience's dead.
Bittersweet, bitterweet tears run down,
All that time, I choked, I drowned,
I bled these thoughts again and again,
In my mind again, and again...
$
Love to love,
Love to be loved.
Love a person,
Love a person inside and out.
To judge is to hurt,
To hurt is to not love.
Not to love is not to love yourself,
Not to love yourself is not to love other.
Not to love other is not to recieve love,
Not to recieve love hurts
Everyone in the end.

Love was.....
When 'if' lay between you and I
And 'never' seemed forever
I fell to earth in surrender
And you became the centre of my eye
Love is.....
When I pass by you accidentally
I grab a sense of your smile
When between us is distance measured by the mile
I grab a sense of our love immeasurably
Love will be.....
When I can no longer see to see
When I can no longer hear to hear
I know you will be near
Simply just you and me
Love eternally.....
When God granted us our wish finally
He put in us a throbbing heart
When it stops from this earth we will depart
But our Love will live eternally

LOVE - what is love?  A great and aching heart;
Wrung hands; and silence; and a long despair.
Life - what is life?  Upon a moorland bare
To see love coming and see love depart.

Thus piteously Love closed what he begat:
The union of this ever-diverse pair!
These two were rapid falcons in a snare,
Condemned to do the flitting of the bat.
Lovers beneath the singing sky of May,
They wandered once; clear as the dew on flowers:
But they fed not on the advancing hours:
Their hearts held cravings for the buried day.
Then each applied to each that fatal knife,
Deep questioning, which probes to endless dole.
Ah, what a dusty answer gets the soul
When hot for certainties in this our life!--
In tragic hints here see what evermore
Moves dark as yonder midnight ocean's force,
Thundering like ramping hosts of warrior horse,
To throw that faint thin line upon the shore!
$
Love ere he bleeds, an eagle in high skies,
Has earth beneath his wings: from reddened eve
He views the rosy dawn. In vain they weave
The fatal web below while far he flies.
But when the arrow strikes him, there's a change.
He moves but in the track of his spent pain,
Whose red drops are the links of a harsh chain,
Binding him to the ground, with narrow range.
A subtle serpent then has Love become.
I had the eagle in my bosom erst:
Henceforward with the serpent I am cursed.
I can interpret where the mouth is dumb.
Speak, and I see the side-lie of a truth.
Perchance my heart may pardon you this deed:
But be no coward:--you that made Love bleed,
You must bear all the venom of his tooth!
$
more than a love, I Love You...
I would travel a thousand miles, just to be with you...
I would yell with a high voice, just to hear me from there...
I would cry  with no stop, just to let you feel within me as i do...
I would write a thousand love poems, just to see how much i think of you...
I would climb and fly to the end of sky, just to let you know that my world you are...
i would touch the sun and the moon, just to give you the passion that you deserve...
i would erase all a sadness from this world, just to keep you happy always in a happiness..
I would hold all a love in this world, just to give it only for you...
more than a love, i love you..
would you love me as i do...

I don't always tell you
that the joy you bring,
brightened my way.
The years you've made
happy by sharing you cared!
I don't always tell you,
that the love you give brightens every day I live.
I'm thinking today of all that we've shared.
You've given encouragement, brightened my ways.
But the most important part of all
my Cherished hopes and plans and dreams.
You've listened to problems, always known what to say.
you mean more to me than anything.
I don't always tell you, how much I loved you!
The memories we've known, all the laughter and fun.
And I just want to say on this day, I set apart.
Darling, I love you with all my Heart!
$
You said to me that you will be there on that day
but when that day came then you were not there for me
So much love showered and so many promises were made
but nothing worked on my way because you had gone
My love, I am crying for you because my love turned blue
The heaven stolen you from me and left the memories only
Though your soul vanished in the sky but my love never dies for you
I tell those angels how much I love you and care for you
and ask them to make your soul always happy till I come to you
My love, I am crying for you because my love turned blue
Looking at your photos and wish you were here with me
Crying for your endless love which become the end of story
I will not see you again but your memories will stay for ever
Now my heart fighting against a raw pain for the lost of my love
My love, I am crying for you because my love turned blue
$
When I love you so, then I look at your eyes
Love can be anything when you are in my arms
My love, I love you more than anything in this world
Let me get into your heart to give my love that I have
When I love you so, then I feel your body language
Love can be more than a love when you love me so
My love, I love you as much as you could do
Let me get into your heart to give my power that I have
When I love you so, then I hear your heart beats
Love can be true when you touch me with your soul
My love, I love you the way you love me
Let me get into your heart to give my life that I have

My love, your love, his love, and our love
Are all different from each other
Let me tell you about my love first
My love is very weak
Like the baby
That had just been born
Today
Your love
Is very strong
Like the thunder
That is going on in the sky
Right now
His love
Is very special
Because he is giving
It to us right now
$
O love love love love love love love
Makes me so glad baby makes me so sad
O love love love love love love love
Makes me so good baby makes me so bad
Your warm touch makes me feel like male
Your negligence burns me like hell
O love love love love love love love
What is love baby who can tell?
You can make me feel so dreamy
You can arouse envy in me
O love love love love love love love
Love can make me curse you baby!

PRIMEVAL my love for the woman I love,
O bride! O wife! more resistless, more enduring than I can tell, the
thought of you!
Then separate, as disembodied, the purest born,
The ethereal, the last athletic reality, my consolation,
I ascend--I float in the regions of your love, O man,
O sharer of my roving life.

Am I falling for him or is htis just puppy love? Even though he's not mine I still get weak from his hugs. It's crazy how my parents say it's just puppy love but not this time around.What do I feel when i know im like a rebound? I want him to be the one but who really knows.....? I know he's good just like a pound of dro. So is it puppy love or is it real love? I may never know so this is the way i feel.....

scarlet beats the heart
tranquility in my soul

The side glances of the lover
From the east from the mountains
From the deserts from the wild
Looks to the moon and counts stars
Talks to himself sometime sings
Gets angry soon but loves like mad
Cries like rivers smiles like angel
What he wears what he not
So selfless and in his world lost
Who is he across the table
With candle lit I wait for him
Will he come and whisper sweet
I will show my earring to him
A band on arm a move of my hair
But he looks into my eyes
He is drawing my sketch
Shall not I see him once again
Never love a stranger for they
Make you weep for night and day

I know where shall he go
Seven seas or oceans as he lives
In my heart of flesh and emotions deep
No gold I want but love forlorn
From earth to heaven stars and moon
With one glance of love he shall be mine
Away the seductress the arms you bare
My lips parched of my garment unaware
And thou sayest my love thou steal
My love so pure so pure like a child
From Eden descended and anointed with waters
That I brought from my spring of love
23/1/2009
$
The sun went down for the night to cover
The earth that lay bare in front of me
Like the face you hide for the lover to adore
The curves and lines the dusk of your beauty
Like dark clouds pattering the aroma of earth
The sketch on coal on the white of moon
The river convulsing in matriarchal rage
When I was the shore infinite for the deluge
Overflowing and exuding like volcano
On the sand I made and made again
From the moon the sketch I remember
The reflection in the river with a soul
It was like the jewel on your forehead
The wounds on my heart when I blow
Who says forgetfulness I have acquired
Nothing is left of me for my self to know
Eloquence I add to words like music
In counterpoint when it turns on itself
Like the lock of your hair that touches
The cheek and the lips when they speak
In the colors of fire thou appear to me
Remove my name from the verse of venom
Thou shalt be Cleopatra and thou shalt take
Thy life with lust to be bitten by serpent
The serpent of love that thou playeth with
And when my blood thou shall rub on thy cheek
And mourn the beaten bosom for the lost love

Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed
And worthy of acceptation. Fire is bright,
Let temple burn, or flax; an equal light
Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed:
And love is fire. And when I say at need
I love thee . . . mark! . . . I love thee—in thy sight
I stand transfigured, glorified aright,
With conscience of the new rays that proceed
Out of my face toward thine. There's nothing low
In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures
Who love God, God accepts while loving so.
And what I feel, across the inferior features
Of what I am, doth flash itself, and show
How that great work of Love enhances Nature's.

The measure of love, in truth, is this:
To treasure each sigh, close by, then kiss!
I've revelled each girl I yearn,
Just to discern
The measure of love!
Soft embraces, gazes...
In search for one true friend...
Let go... then watching love grow...
Then lips pressed tight, just right,
As if our two hearts said, 'Hello! '
Love prays this is so...
The measure is true in gentlemen...
Right out of the blue! So who knows when?
It's meant to astound you, too...
So you can view
The measure of love!
$
I once was asked concerning love versus hate
Why does it seem that hate is so great?
While hate is a very strong emotion too
Nothing can equal love that is true
The weight of hate is very heavy to bear
While it seems like love is lighter than air
Accounts of hate make a big news headline
While actions of love you must look hard to find
But when you consider that love is patient, kind,
Envieth not, not pompous, not puffed up, not rude,
Seeketh not her own, slow to anger, thinks no evil,
Rejoices not in wrong doing, but rejoices in the truth,
Bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,
Endures all things, and never fails*
You soon learn that the density of love is so much,
Although the scales be heaped with a great volume of hate
It's catapulted by a mere measure of love's touch,
Love strengthens the bearer so one feels not its weight

To Love Or Not To Love
That is the question
Should or shouldn't we
To know love
To be love
You've got to feel love
You've got to know
When your in love
Or not
Do you know how it fills
To be in love
You've got to feel it
It feels so good to be in love
Your head rushes
Your heart beats
A million beats a minute
You can't stand it
When you have to be away
From him/ her for long periods of time
You think about him/ her 24/7
You dream about him/ her
You day dream about him/ her
To love or not to love
To love you've got to know
The risk of what happens
After you love
Not to love you've got to know
That this is really what you want
To feel love you've got to be love
You've got to love him your self
That is why
To love or not to love
Is and has always been
The main question of loving
This is why most people love
Know that they know every thing
About the person and the risks
This is why we love
Because we love him/ her
This is why we don't love
You don't know the person that well
Love and be happy
Or
Not love and be misserble
So I love
Just like others should too

If true love is love truly
then let true love be true
don't rip a hole in my chest
and crush my blood pump
if you are not surely sure
then walky walk out the front door
cause i'm not playing tricky tricks
or hide and find
with your playful mind
If true love is love truly
then let true love be true
stay with me and love me
and i'll stay with you and love you

They say watching someone you love
Love someone else
Is the hardest thing you can do.
But did they know that it
Can also snap you in two?
Rip out your heart and disconnect
Your soul,
Make you weep every night alone
In the cold,
From being alive and ok with things,
Your mind turns to black,
And the hatred it brings
Makes you aware of yourself,
For better, for worse,
In sickness, in health,
Suddenly it seams
You’re in your own personal hell
You know not from where
It was that you fell,
And all this because
I love you with all,
But all I got in return
Was another brick wall.
$
Why do we love love so much when it never did us any good,
We love love for the fun of it, or just because we know we could.
But the question is, why do love hate us,
I always said, ' It's better love than lust.'
Love hates us because we never show ownership,
We just see each other as friends, we don't even see a relationship.
Love doesn't hate us, it's just we abuse it so,
Because once love is given to us, we don't want it anymore.
We do love love, and love loves us too,
Love is just tired of the different ways it's used.

for feeling cross heart of  seas like love
passionate roses and  lips
sweet  body and lovely soul of venus

any wars?

You give to me hope
And help me to cope
When life pulls me down
You bring me around
You teach me to care
And help me to share
You make me honest
With kindness the best
From you I learned love
With grace from above
It's for you I live
And I want to give
You are the reason
That fills each season
When I hear love I think of you
You are my world and best friend too
I love you because you are so kind, thoughtful and caring
I love you because you are so pleasant, lovely and sharing
You made me the man I am
Thank you

Something makes me sad

Something makes me glad
You're not aroun'
'Cause you let me down
Wishing you were here
Wishing you were near
Wishing you were clear
But you confoun'
'Cause you let me down
Now that I am blue
Now that we are through
Now that he's with you
I hope you frown
'Cause you let me down
You have gone away
You have made his day
You have lost your way
Your sin aboun'
